Code Description:
This Matlab code provides an implementation of an algorithm named CGUFS-IMC, designed specifically for handling incomplete multi-view data. It adopts an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, integrating multiple tasks—including data imputation, feature selection, self-representation, and consensus graph learning—into a unified model. This approach effectively leverages multi-view information while addressing the challenges posed by missing data.

Code Structure Overview:
The code is divided into four main parts: data and parameter initialization, the main ADMM iteration loop, and several important helper functions.

Data and Parameter Initialization (Section 1-3):

This section first prepares all necessary variables and parameters for the algorithm.

Y_incomplete_normalized: A cell array storing the Z-score normalized incomplete multi-view data. NaN values represent missing data.

Mask: A cell array corresponding to Y_incomplete_normalized, where 1 indicates an observed data point and 0 indicates a missing data point.

params: A struct containing all tunable hyperparameters, such as regularization weights (alpha, beta, tau, gamma), ADMM penalty parameters (rho1, rho2, rho3), and the number of iterations (max_iter), among others.

Variable Initialization: Initializes various variables and intermediate matrices required for the ADMM algorithm, including:

Y_completed_views: Used to store the completed data matrices.

A_views, S_views, C_views: Self-representation matrices, similarity matrices for available samples, and projection matrices, respectively.

D_mat, K_mat: Orthogonal basis and pseudo-cluster label matrices that represent the clustering structure.

H_tensor, H_star, lambda_weights: View-specific intrinsic tensors, the consensus similarity matrix, and view weights, respectively.

Lagrange multipliers (J1, J2, J3) and auxiliary variables (Y_bar, Z).

Main ADMM Iteration Loop (Section 4):

This is the core of the algorithm, where all variables in the model are iteratively updated within the ADMM framework.

Update Process: In each iteration, the code sequentially executes the following sub-steps, each corresponding to a closed-form solution or an efficient solving method for an ADMM subproblem:

Update Y_completed_v: The completed view data is updated by minimizing a subproblem that includes the self-representation term and a data imputation constraint.

Update C^v: The view-specific projection matrix is updated by solving a weighted least squares problem, which incorporates L2,1-norm regularization and graph regularization.

Update S^v: The similarity matrix for available samples is updated by constructing a Confidence Graph and integrating the self-representation matrix A^v.

Update A^v: The self-representation matrix for each view is updated by minimizing the self-representation error.

Update D and K: The orthogonal basis D and pseudo-cluster labels K are updated using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Update B and E1: The self-representation error B and noise tensor E1 are updated via L2,1-norm minimization.

Update H and H_star: The intrinsic tensor H is updated using a Weighted Tensor Nuclear Norm (WTNN), and the consensus similarity matrix H_star is obtained through view fusion.

Update lambda^v: View weights are dynamically adjusted based on the distance between each view's intrinsic tensor and the consensus matrix.

Update auxiliary variables: Y_bar and Z are updated.

Update Lagrange multipliers: J1, J2, J3 are updated.

Helper Functions:

calculate_confidence_graph: Constructs a confidence graph based on available data points.

update_C_v: Solves the subproblem for updating the projection matrix C, employing an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) strategy.

update_S_v: Updates the similarity matrix S by combining Euclidean distance and self-representation information.

Solve_L21_norm: Solves the L2,1-norm minimization problem, used for updating B and E1.

update_H_tensor_WTNN: Solves the Weighted Tensor Nuclear Norm minimization problem to update the intrinsic tensor H. This function utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for computational acceleration.
