#Code Description:
This Matlab code provides an implementation of an algorithm named CGUFS-IMC, designed specifically for handling incomplete multi-view data. It adopts an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, integrating multiple tasks—including data imputation, feature selection, self-representation, and consensus graph learning—into a unified model. This approach effectively leverages multi-view information while addressing the challenges posed by missing data.
